# OOP-using-python
This repository is created as part of my learning journey to understand object-oriented programming in Python, focusing on core principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. The purpose of this project is to strengthen my OOP skills and apply these concepts to real-world problem solving.
